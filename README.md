# Employee Data Preprocessing

This notebook focuses on data preprocessing, which is an essential step in data analysis or machine learning workflows. It begins by importing necessary libraries, including `pandas` for data manipulation and `sklearn.preprocessing` for tasks like scaling and encoding. The dataset, named `employee.csv`, is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` and contains columns such as `name`, `age`, `income`, `gender`, `department`, `grade`, and `performance_score`. An initial exploration of the data is performed, displaying the first few rows using `df.head()` to understand its structure and contents. The column names are printed with `df.columns`, and summary statistics for numerical columns, including `age`, `income`, and `performance_score`, are generated with `df.describe()`. Additionally, specific rows (2 to 4) are displayed to observe individual entries. These steps set the foundation for cleaning and preparing the dataset for further analysis or modeling.
